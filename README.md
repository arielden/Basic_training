BASIC TRAINING
=======

alpha software
--------------

This is alpha software. All the test cases and examples work but there will be
many issues outside of the test framework. The CATIA com interface is huge and
I'm currently just attacking the items I think will be most useful. The
framework is in place for others to contribute so if you know CATIA and python
please do contribute. Bonus points for adding tests too.

I have limited access to CATIA licences / workbenches so will not be able to
support those I can't test. If your company would like support for additional
workbenches adding to pycatia and can provide a license please contact me.
